# Legacy components

Charts created with Echart have been replaced by the UPlot library.

Reasons:
- Render time for large datasets
- Package size (Echart -> 41.5 MB, UPlot -> 492 kB)
- Better maintenance and customization

### More:

Echarts components have not been removed due to the possibility of using the knowledge in later software development and possibly separating them into a separate npm package to support building charts in Echarts.
